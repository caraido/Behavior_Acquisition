    'correction': True,  # whether to correct for 1/f noise
    'readRate': 3,  # how frequently to read data from the Daq's off-board data buffer

    # notes on parameters:

    # window, overlap, fMin, fMax are taken from deepsqueak
    # fs needs to be at least twice the highest frequency of interest, ideally higher
    # window*fs should be a power of 2 (or at least even) for optimal computation of fft
    # the higher the readRate, the better the performance, but the latency of plotting increases

    # nFreq determines the number of frequencies that are plotted (by cubic interpolation), not calculated
    # the browser also performs some interpolation, so nFreq should be as low as possible to see features of interest
