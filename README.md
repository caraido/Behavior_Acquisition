## Overview

Behavior Acquisition is a software toolkit designed for researchers and practitioners to collect, process, and analyze behavioral data. This project provides a streamlined pipeline for acquiring behavioral measurements through various input methods, with a focus on reliability, reproducibility, and ease of use.

## Features

- **Multi-modal Data Collection**: Capture behavioral data from various sources (video, sensors, manual input)
- **Automated Processing Pipeline**: Convert raw data into structured formats suitable for analysis
- **Customizable Analysis Tools**: Apply various analytical methods to extracted behavioral metrics
- **Visualization Components**: Generate insightful visualizations of behavioral patterns and trends
- **Integration Capabilities**: Compatible with common research and analysis frameworks

## Architecture

The software follows a modular architecture that separates concerns:

1. **Data Acquisition Module**: Interfaces with hardware devices and data sources to collect raw behavioral data
2. **Processing Engine**: Transforms raw data into standardized formats through filtering, normalization, and feature extraction
3. **Analysis Framework**: Applies statistical methods and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and anomalies
4. **Visualization Layer**: Renders results in an interpretable format through graphs, charts, and interactive displays

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/caraido/Behavior_Acquisition.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Behavior_Acquisition

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run setup script
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from behavior_acquisition import DataCollector, Processor, Analyzer

# Initialize data collection
collector = DataCollector(source_type="video", source_path="path/to/video.mp4")

# Collect and process data
raw_data = collector.collect()
processor = Processor(raw_data)
processed_data = processor.process(methods=["normalization", "feature_extraction"])

# Analyze processed data
analyzer = Analyzer(processed_data)
results = analyzer.analyze(method="pattern_recognition")

# Visualize results
analyzer.visualize(results, plot_type="time_series")
```

### Advanced Configuration

The system supports advanced configuration through YAML files:

```yaml
# config.yaml
acquisition:
  source_type: video
  parameters:
    framerate: 30
    resolution: [1920, 1080]
    
processing:
  pipeline:
    - filter_type: gaussian
      kernel_size: 5
    - normalization: z_score
    
analysis:
  methods:
    - name: cluster_analysis
      parameters:
        algorithm: dbscan
        eps: 0.5
```

## Applications

This toolkit is particularly useful for:

- **Neuroscience Research**: Tracking and analyzing animal or human movements in experimental settings
- **Clinical Assessment**: Quantifying behavioral patterns for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes
- **HCI Studies**: Measuring user interactions with systems or interfaces
- **Behavioral Ecology**: Monitoring and analyzing animal behavior in natural environments
